      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I have used the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/&#34;&gt;GOV.UK Prototype Kit&lt;/a&gt;
to build a prototype I have always hosted it on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.heroku.com/&#34;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;. The main reason for doing this was because
it was just so easy (I wrote a
&lt;a href=&#34;./posts/how-to-setup-a-simple-heroku-pipeline/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about just how easy it
was many years ago), it was also the default approach - until recently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accessing an environment variable within Neovim from a lua script is straight
forward. It is just a case of calling &lt;code&gt;vim.env.env-var-name&lt;/code&gt; where
&lt;code&gt;env-var-name&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the environment variable e.g.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, if you belong to multiple organisations it
is easy to have those notifications routed to specific email addresses. This is
very useful if, for example, you use the same GitHub account for work and
personal use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within a Svelte project seeing an error such as
&lt;code&gt;cannot find module &#39;$lib/..&#39; or its corresponding type declarations&lt;/code&gt; can be
resolved by running &lt;code&gt;npm run prepare&lt;/code&gt;. This will update &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; to add
&lt;code&gt;$lib&lt;/code&gt; to

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Decisions are made all of the time when developing software. Some decisions are
small and easy to change such as the name of a variable or whether to extract
some code into a separate class/function/module. Other decisions are larger and
more difficult to change such as which test framework to use, whether to use
JSON or XML or if a NoSQL database should be used in favour of a SQL database,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

a specific service or services from Docker Compose. By default these commands
work with an optional list of services. Each service specified will have the

However, it can be kept for

      <guid>https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/til/hugo/ordering-content/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is straight forward to order content in Hugo by leveraging front matter
variables. The default order is &lt;code&gt;Weight -&amp;gt; Date -&amp;gt; LinkTitle -&amp;gt; FilePath&lt;/code&gt;.
It is easy to change the order based on the specific property of interest. See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/#order-content&#34;&gt;lists of content in Hugo&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to keep a record of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done in some form or
other. I&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with &lt;a href=&#34;https://weeknot.es/&#34;&gt;week notes&lt;/a&gt; (effectively a
summary of what you did over the past week that you might make public, or just
keep private).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common architectural style (at the time of writing) is to split up
applications into many, smaller, more focussed applications. Frequently this
style is known by the term &lt;code&gt;microservices&lt;/code&gt;. When working with microservices
I&amp;rsquo;ve rarely had the need to run, and actually use, more than a single web
application concurrently in my development environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

using it in the first place or learning better ways of doing and thinking
about things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

soon after it was published but never got round to publishing this post, which
I wrote at the same time but have edited more recently so I could publish it.
The post contains some thoughts I had about the video and thought it would be
worth capturing them and maybe try to get back into blogging at some regular
interval, although clearly that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen at the time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;a href=&#34;../teamcity-pipeline/&#34;&gt;setup&lt;/a&gt; with my colleagues, it
was pointed out every build was creating a new NuGet package. Not great when
you consider every branch was triggering a build and most of those branches
were not &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to provide a consistent development environment between team members
as well as making it easier to do physical pair programming sharing a

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy introducing people to Git. Pretty much without fail they see how
much better their development work-flow can be and find their work more
enjoyable as a result. This is especially true if they are coming from a TFS
background. See how I work with
&lt;a href=&#34;../how-i-work-with-git-and-tfs/&#34;&gt;Git and TFS&lt;/a&gt;.
However, with pleasure comes pain. For Git, that pain is in getting over the
learning curve. The size and steepness of the curve varies depending on
previous experience of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software&#34;&gt;Version Control Systems&lt;/a&gt;.
In my experience, TFS does not provide a good base knowledge to work from as it
tries to hide as much as possible from the user. Clearly Git is doing a lot for
you too but the way it works is more exposed. For example, even the most basic
of things like adding files into the index can seem strange to a TFS user.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>üìâ What lessons should one learn from the Gliffy outage?</title>
      <link>https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/gliffy-outage-lessons/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/gliffy-outage-lessons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since the recent lengthy and complete
&lt;a href=&#34;http://support.gliffy.com/entries/98911057-RESOLVED-Gliffy-Online-System-Outage-&#34;&gt;outage of Gliffy&lt;/a&gt;,
I have been thinking about how I could (should that be a should?) protect
myself when working with SaaS. Everything is sorted now and Gliffy have a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gliffy.com/blog/2016/03/25/turtle-and-the-hare/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; explaining
a bit more detail on the outage. One of the takeaways from that being disaster
recovery plans should probably be practiced more often.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>üë∫ Interesting articles (week one)</title>

      <guid>https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/interesting-articles/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked to provide a link to an article that had resonated with me
in the recent past. The first thing I did was provide a link to my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/st3v3nhunt&#34;&gt;twitter account&lt;/a&gt; to that person. Thinking
(hoping) the question would be answered.
The second thing I did was to go through some of my time line to see what
articles I had tweeted about. One of the things I found was I didn&amp;rsquo;t tweet all
that often about articles I find align well to how I think. There are some but
there is a lot of stuff I read and do nothing with. There are even fewer tweets
about things I don&amp;rsquo;t feel align well with me which is probably a good thing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post has been one I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write for months and months.
Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ve got round to it! This does mean specifics are going to be few and

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines&#34;&gt;Pipelines in Heroku&lt;/a&gt; are
pretty awesome. This is how I went about setting up a Node.js app to have
automated deployments for all pull requests, an automated deployment to the
staging environment and a manual stage for promoting to the production
environment. Pretty much a bread and butter pipeline.
&lt;em&gt;(This is an image heavy post)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;git branch -r&lt;/code&gt; to check the list of branches on the remote can often
lead to a long list of branches making it difficult to tell which are active

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The team I work in uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://trello.com&#34;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; to visualise our work.
Some of the team have been using similar tools in order to facilitate work
visualisation for several years. Other members are much newer to the concept.
Recently the team had a refresher session to bring everybody up to a similar
level of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
