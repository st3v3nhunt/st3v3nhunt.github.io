Some of them have always been the way I’ve tried to work and others have been adopted after having been burnt by not using it in the first place or learning better ways of doing and thinking about things.\nAs with almost everything, the context around which I am working impacts on how closely the principle is able to be implemented but I try to apply them as often as is appropriately possible.\nThe principles in this post are closely related to software development activities and are in no particular order, although I have tried to group similar ones. It is by no means an exhaustive list of the principles I follow. I will aim to add to the post every so often as I recall principles and discover new ones. The definition of the term principle will be stretched here and there to encompass guidelines and practices too.\nThis is likely to be the first in a series of posts on ways of working and thinking I tend to subscribe to.\nBe cautious using latest Whether a Docker image, Helm chart, code dependency or pretty much anything else you care to think about, using the latest version of it needs to be carefully considered. If the use of latest is simply a way of selecting which version of the thing is going to be used before whatever specific version is locked down that is fine e.g. during initial and active development of something. However, using the latest in situations where the thing will not be locked to a specific version and is resolved at build, deploy or runtime is not a good idea.\nWhilst using latest might seem like an OK thing to do at face value, and indeed, there are some situations where it is perfectly OK. Situations such as initial development and general trialing of something. However, most situations should require a specific version to be recorded and used. The reason being is that when using latest you are not only putting trust in the creator of the thing to have correctly working tagging practices but trusting the creator’s ability to maintain access and security controls.\nUsing latest, in some respects makes a bit of a mockery of testing. If you are testing against the latest version of something what have you actually tested? Is the latest version going to be the same tomorrow or next week or next month?\nAlways increment MAJOR version on any breaking changes Whenever a breaking a change is made to a public interface the MAJOR version should be incremented. Regardless if the aspects of the interface you thought should have been private were the only changes. There is a possibility they were being used and if they were changed without a breaking change version increment the users of them will not be happy. The principle of ‘if it is available, it will have been used’ should be taken to heart and an expectation that there will be users of it.\nTreat any API the same as you would a web API By that I mean, if there is an API that is accessible, whether it was meant to be accessible or not, it should be treated as such. Consequentially, when breaking changes are made MAJOR versions should be incremented to indicate the change.\nThe rule of three When something has been done for a third time or you know it will be done or used at least three times it is worth considering doing it in such a way that it will be reusable. That might entail refactoring some code into a shared library or module or it might (in relation to the point about automating as much as possible, below) mean that the activity should be automated.\nThe rule of three is useful for a couple of reasons. If something has been or will be used three times it is likely:\nThere is something within it that is generic enough that it will be possible to extract it into something that is useful to more than three things. However, the context needs to be borne in mind to check this will be the case The details of the reusable bit will be better understood and enable the useful bit to be identified and hopefully the majority of the changes that would be required in future uses of it Use automated release note generation Something like semantic-release can be used to automatically create release notes and correctly increment versions. Ideally an automated release note will satisfy all requirements for all intended audiences. However, if that isn’t the case, having a release note that is already created will be much easier to add to than one that needs to be created from scratch.\nAutomate as much as possible, whenever possible Automating as much as possible is a good reason for the purpose of not only having a system that can perform the task at hand quicker than a human, with fewer mistakes than a human, it also has the major benefit or codifying the task.\nCodification of the task is a huge benefit as it means it doesn’t need to be maintained in the memory of humans or written down in a non-executable form (that will become incorrect at some point and ultimately cause confusion as the humans will not know which is correct). Codifying tasks effectively delegates the memory storage of the details.\nMuch like the rule of three (above), the task being automated should be assessed as to whether it will repay the investment in the automation before blindly trying to automate it. Some tasks are complex, can be automated easily and are run many times. However, there are other tasks that are simple, take significant effort to automate and run infrequently. With the majority falling between these extremes. There really isn’t a golden rule as to when a task should be automated as it very much depends on the context.\nIt is worth mentioning that there is the additional benefit of the codification of the task to take into consideration when deciding whether to automate. If a task is run infrequently it might very well be the case it is difficult to recall the steps and it would be beneficial if it could just be run without having to recall the details, and having those details captured in an executable form..\nUse a linter Set a standard for the syntax of the language being used and, as much as possible (really, it should be a never event), do not change it. Using a linter to validate and prevent syntax issues being part of code review discussion has a number of benefits:\nQuicker feedback on issues, no need to wait for a review More consistent code as linter will not miss discrepancies like a human would No time needs to be spent on bike-shedding Reviews can focus on important issues Health checks Have some way of accessing key info about what you are building, whether that is a web frontend or a backend microservice. Something like a health check (as used by Kubernetes) with key information about the thing e.g. the deployed version, memory use, CPU user, uptime, concurrent users, etc.\n","wordCount":"1220","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-02-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-03-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Steve Hunt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/dev-principles-and-practices/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"blog.st3v3nhunt.me","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/ accesskey=h title="blog.st3v3nhunt.me (Alt + H)">blog.st3v3nhunt.me</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/til/ title=TIL><span>TIL</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>✨ Development practices and principles</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2021-02-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>28 February 2021&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;6 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;Steve Hunt&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/st3v3nhunt/st3v3nhunt.github.io/tree/main/content/posts/dev-principles-and-practices.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#be-cautious-using-latest aria-label="Be cautious using latest">Be cautious using <code>latest</code></a></li><li><a href=#always-increment-major-version-on-any-breaking-changes aria-label="Always increment MAJOR version on any breaking changes"><strong>Always</strong> increment <code>MAJOR</code> version on any breaking changes</a></li><li><a href=#treat-any-api-the-same-as-you-would-a-web-api aria-label="Treat any API the same as you would a web API">Treat any API the same as you would a web API</a></li><li><a href=#the-rule-of-three aria-label="The rule of three">The rule of three</a></li><li><a href=#use-automated-release-note-generation aria-label="Use automated release note generation">Use automated release note generation</a></li><li><a href=#automate-as-much-as-possible-whenever-possible aria-label="Automate as much as possible, whenever possible">Automate as much as possible, whenever possible</a></li><li><a href=#use-a-linter aria-label="Use a linter">Use a linter</a></li><li><a href=#health-checks aria-label="Health checks">Health checks</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>During my time working in software development I&rsquo;ve picked up a few guiding
