Finally, I&rsquo;ve got round to it! This does mean specifics are going to be few and
far between&mldr;</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Use <a href=http://git-tfs.com/>git-tfs</a> as a bridge between the awful TFS
and the awesome Git.</p><p>I work in an organisation where the majority of the code is stored in
<a href=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181237.aspx>TFS</a>. I came from a
background where I used <a href=https://subversion.apache.org/>Subversion</a>. As soon
as I started to use TFS I hated it. I can&rsquo;t remember the full list of reasons
why I had such a strong dislike to it (other than because it was different üòâ)
beyond the fact:</p><ul><li>Using it outside of Visual Studio was (probably still is) a very bad idea.</li><li>The connected mode is a real nuisance when working with other people in the
same area of the code.</li><li>The way files were all read only.</li><li>Locked workspaces.</li></ul><p>These points probably all boil down to the always connected mode and that might
have changed since I stopped using it&mldr;I gave up using TFS directly almost
immediately after having first been exposed to it.</p><p>My first foray into hiding the awfulness of TFS was to use a Git to TFS bridge
called <a href=https://gittf.codeplex.com/>Git-TF</a>. I used this for several months
before I found there were some short-comings with it, that, at the time I was
unable to work around. I forget exactly what they were but I have a feeling the
ability to deal with files names over 256 characters in length might have had
something to do with it.</p><p>On the lookout for an alternative I came across <a href=http://git-tfs.com/>git-tfs</a>
which I still use to this day. I have found git-tfs to be an invaluable
companion ever-since, even if the file length problem still exists. Fortunately
it is easily worked around with the
<a href=https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/blob/master/doc/commands/clone.md#set-a-custom-tfs-workspace-directory><code>--workspace=</code></a>
option.</p><p>Another niggle, which is nothing to do with how git-tfs works but is a result
of the structure of the code in the TFS repo is how I need to clone multiple
directories within a number of repos in order to have some semblance of
separation in how the code lives on my development machine. Add to that the way
branching is done and
<a href=https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/blob/master/doc/commands/quick-clone.md><code>quick-clone</code></a>
has become one of my favourite commands!</p><p>The final piece to the way I work with TFS puzzle is using <a href=http://www.attrice.info/cm/tfs/index.htm>TFS
Sidekicks</a>. I use this to do things I
could do with the git-tfs but am too lazy to do such as a quick visual check on
the history of the repo or, and this is its' main use, to view other people&rsquo;s
shelvesets.</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=/posts/development/interesting-articles/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i><span class=navigation-tittle>Interesting Articles (week one)</span></a>
