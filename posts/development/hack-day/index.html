question was 01/02/2016 so some details are going to be a little inaccurate but
hopefully the essence is maintained.</p><hr><p>Once upon a time I participated in a
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon>hack day</a> where not a single line of
code was written.
&ldquo;Hang on&rdquo;, I hear you cry. How can you have a hack day without doing any
hacking? Indeed, this is exactly what I was wondering. Looking around the
Internet for definitions and details of hack days, the vast majority of them
talk about technology and software as a core part of the day. However, there
are a number of information sources where hack days are discussed in the
context of no software hacking being involved. I think in these instances it is
better to think of the day as a product ideation day which is exactly what it
turned out to be. Not quite as snappy a title as &lsquo;hack day&rsquo; though üòâ!</p><p>With that cleared up, what was the day like?</p><h2 id=what-did-we-do-during-the-day>What did we do during the day?</h2><ul><li>Met new people</li><li>Selected a user need (from a pre-defined list)</li><li>Fleshed out the user need (with a micro-persona and acceptance criteria)</li><li>Expanded on the solution/need</li><li>Refined the solution</li><li>Created a (paper based) prototype</li><li>Carried out user research (with members of the other groups)</li><li>Iterated the solution based on feedback</li><li>Replayed it all to the group (providing everybody a chance to see each others
prototype and gain some insight into each group&rsquo;s thinking)</li></ul><h2 id=outputs-from-the-day>Outputs from the day</h2><p>Beyond the opportunity to meet and work with (potentially) an entirely new
group of people, thinking from a number of different POVs is a really
refreshing exercise. Empathising is an underused skill by most people and this
day really requires people to empathise. A lot.
From thinking about how a person/people within a set scenario might actually be
feeling and how that translates into generating their &lsquo;needs&rsquo; to thinking about
what the future might look like for them individually and society as a whole.
From understanding the new people you are working with in double quick time in
order to combine to form a productive group to thinking about how other groups
saw the challenge and solved it. The process is much more important than the
outcome in days like this.</p><h2 id=changes-i-would-make-for-future-days>Changes I would make for future days</h2><ul><li>Name the day more clearly (it helps to set expectations early)</li><li>Ensure the constraints being worked within are well understood by
participants e.g. it needs to be something possible to build tomorrow vs
something that might be possible in 5 years time. This helps prototypes to be
of a similar &lsquo;feel&rsquo; rather than having some being current period solutions
and others being far-future Sci-Fi dreams! Unless that is what you want in
which case go for it.</li></ul><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>I enjoyed the day and will look to participate in future days. I highly
recommend others getting involved given the chance. And if not given the chance
it is reasonably easy to set something up yourself.</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=/posts/development/how-to-setup-a-simple-heroku-pipeline/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i><span class=navigation-tittle>How to setup a simple Heroku pipeline</span></a>
