in the recent past. The first thing I did was provide a link to my
<a href=https://twitter.com/st3v3nhunt>twitter account</a> to that person. Thinking
(hoping) the question would be answered.
The second thing I did was to go through some of my time line to see what
articles I had tweeted about. One of the things I found was I didn&rsquo;t tweet all
that often about articles I find align well to how I think. There are some but
there is a lot of stuff I read and do nothing with. There are even fewer tweets
about things I don&rsquo;t feel align well with me which is probably a good thing!</p><p>This got me thinking it might be a good idea to collate a list of articles I
find interesting / have resonance with me. This is the first in what I hope
will be a series. I will aim for once every two weeks and see how well I can
stick to the schedule. As this is the first week the articles go back quite
some time which is most likely going to change in the future, as in probably
soured from the previous two weeks. I have a feeling the format will change
too, as will how closely related the articles are to one another.</p><hr><p><strong>Article</strong>:

places of Pi, yet it has been calculated to over
<a href=http://www.numberworld.org/misc_runs/pi-12t/>12 trillion</a>! The post
demonstrates how it is not necessarily critical to know everything, especially
about something that is not possible to know everything about before it is OK
to use it. I see this an allegory for how organisations spend so much effort on
trying to know more about things that have an inherently unending point of what
can be known before actually starting the doing.</p><hr><p><strong>Article</strong>:
