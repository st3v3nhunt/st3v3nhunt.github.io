much better their development work-flow can be and find their work more
enjoyable as a result. This is especially true if they are coming from a TFS
background. See how I work with
<a href=https://st3v3nhunt.github.io/how-i-work-with-git-and-tfs/>Git and TFS</a>.
However, with pleasure comes pain. For Git, that pain is in getting over the
learning curve. The size and steepness of the curve varies depending on
previous experience of
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software>Version Control Systems</a>.
In my experience, TFS does not provide a good base knowledge to work from as it
tries to hide as much as possible from the user. Clearly Git is doing a lot for
you too but the way it works is more exposed. For example, even the most basic
of things like adding files into the index can seem strange to a TFS user.</p><p>Each time I introduce people to Git I cover most of the same things. I&rsquo;ve used
crib sheets in the past but for the most recent round of introductions I
thought I would write a post about it. This is that post!</p><h2 id=why-use-git>Why use Git?</h2><p>I should really do a post specifically explaining the reasons I like to use
Git. For the sake of brevity, these are the
<a href=https://git-scm.com/about>official reasons</a>.</p><h2 id=branch-name-conventions>Branch name conventions</h2><p>I find it useful to have some conventions for the name of branches that will be
pushed to the remote repository. I tend to use:</p><ul><li>feature/descriptive-name-of-feature</li><li>fix/descriptive-name-of-fix</li></ul><p>Naming conventions makes having specific things happening downstream easy e.g.
deploy any and only feature branches to a brand new test environment. I
wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily want to do that for a fix branch, perhaps that would be
deployed over the top of the existing environment.
Having known reserved branch names also means people are free to push branches
with non-reserved names for their own purposes e.g. backup or sharing.</p><h2 id=commit-message-conventions>Commit message conventions</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve previously written about how I think
<a href=https://st3v3nhunt.github.io/how-much-is-an-emoji-worth/>emojis add</a> to the
information contained within a commit message. And how to
<a href=https://st3v3nhunt.github.io/are-your-commit-messages-insightful/>provide insight</a>
into the change being made, as opposed to simply regurgitating the change being
made.</p><p>In addition to the points above I like to have the commit message adhere to the
convention of starting with an emoji followed by a relatively short and
succinct message. There are a number of good posts discussing this subject in
detail,
<a href=http://who-t.blogspot.co.uk/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html>On commit messages</a>
and <a href=http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>A Note About Git Commit Messages</a>
to name two.
To summarise, the commit message should ideally have:</p><ul><li>An emoji to start with!</li><li>A first line, the summary message, length of ~50 characters</li><li>A blank line after the summary, when there are additional comment lines</li><li>Additional comment lines not exceed ~72 characters</li></ul><h2 id=commit-conventions>Commit conventions</h2><p>Good commits should generally:</p><ul><li>Include a single thing i.e. renaming and fixing are different things and do
not belong in the same commit</li><li>Be as small as possible. If you are ever tempted to just do that really small
extra change in a commit - don&rsquo;t. Finish up what you are doing and do the
other thing in another commit. You (and your colleagues) will thank yourself
when you need to see what changed when <em>that</em> bug was introduced!</li></ul><h2 id=git-aliases>Git aliases</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve got another <a href=https://st3v3nhunt.github.io/git-aliases/>post</a> on git
aliases and how to share them.</p><h2 id=branch-protection>Branch protection</h2><p>I have found out the hard way, protecting branches is a very good idea. No
force pushing to master (or any other shared branch) is an absolute necessity
for your sanity.</p><h2 id=mergepull-request-assignments>Merge/Pull* request assignments</h2><p>When an MR is created you are asked a number of questions. One of them being
who you would like to assign it too. The question does not need to be answered
immediately, or ever in fact. However, it is a good idea to have the team know
how this works in order to avoid the
<a href=https://gist.github.com/st3v3nhunt/f71a36f697b3392310fffeead01541b7>whose job is it anyway</a>
problem.</p><p>Working in a small team the rule I usually work by is to not have the MR
creator assign anybody. The first person to get to the MR assigns them self.
The problem of nobody assigning themselves can happen but when everybody knows
each other in the team and there is good communication about what people are
doing this tends to not be the case. It also allows the people who are free to
get to the MR rather than possibly interrupting people in the middle of
something else.</p><p>* When I use the terms merge request (MR) and pull request (PR) I so do
interchangeably.</p><h2 id=delete-merged-branches>Delete merged branches</h2><p>Good housekeeping is to remove branches once they have been merged. When using
lots of branches the number of merged branches hanging around can get a bit out
of hand. Removing them as soon as they have been merged solves this problem.</p><h2 id=keep-a-useful-history>Keep a useful history</h2><p>As has been discussed above, keeping commits small and focused is a good idea.
Following this principle is a great way of achieving a clean and more
importantly, a useful history.</p><p>MRs introduce an opportunity for that guidance to be difficult to follow. For
example, if there have been several small commits created in order to build a
feature - when that feature comes to be merged, should those commits be
retained or should they be squashed into a single commit? Prior to
<a href=https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits>April 1st 2016</a> the only
option on GitHub was merge commits. A merge commit retains the details of the
history of the branch unless those commits had been squashed by the branch
owner. I used to think having the branch history squashed was a good idea as it
would be a clean entry. However, I now think the benefit of having the detailed
commit history and how the feature was built is more valuable. That is not to
say squashing commits that are not &lsquo;complete&rsquo; should not be done - they should
be squashed if they provide no value.</p><p>In summary, I think having both merge commits and
<a href=https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merge-squashing/>squash merging</a>
options available on a GitHub repository is good.</p><p>The most important thing to keep in mind is that commits should provide value
to the code base and by following the guidance here you will be on the way to
doing so.</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=/posts/development/teamcity-pipeline/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i><span class=navigation-tittle>TeamCity Build Pipeline</span></a>
