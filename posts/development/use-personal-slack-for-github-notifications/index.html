<a href=https://git-scm.com/>Git</a> repository. I would put it in my top 2 along with
<a href=https://gitlab.com/>GitLab</a>.</p><p>However, I have a love/hate relationship with the notifications. In so far as I
hate them. I find the emails are unreliable, sometimes they come through quite
quickly and on other occasions they seem to take an age and I&rsquo;m pretty sure
I&rsquo;ve not received some at all.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tried the web notifications and as far as I can tell they are pretty
useless unless you have a client that will read them and notify you. The
notification UI on the site is OK but I&rsquo;m not interested in having the webpage
open and checking it manually. Perhaps there are some simple ways of working
with them that I&rsquo;ve not come across&mldr;However, I have tried using GitHub
notifier clients such as <a href=http://gitify.io/>Gitify</a> for the desktop and this
<a href=https://github.com/sindresorhus/notifier-for-github-chrome>Chrome extension</a>
but I still don&rsquo;t feel I am getting what I want from the notifications. No
fault of the clients, they <em>seem</em> to work OK.</p><p>If the clients tell me when things happen, what else is it that I want? I think
my problem is I have been spoilt in the past as I have used the GitHub
integration with <a href=https://slack.com/>Slack</a> to pump notifications into a
dedicated GitHub channel. This has provided me with the insight into what I
think it missing - the record of events. It appears to me that the
aforementioned notifiers do little more than read the central GitHub list of
notifications and mark them as read. And when a notification is read it goes,
<em>poof</em>, never to be seen again. Well, not until the all notifications page is
<a href="https://github.com/notifications?all=1">viewed</a>. So whilst the functionality
exists, as already mentioned I don&rsquo;t want to have the page open, manually
checking on it - it just feels a little unloved.</p><p>The good news is using Slack as my GitHub notification hub is a really great
experience, it truly works quite brilliantly. The only slight downer is that I
tend to belong to Slack communities that are on the free tier and the GitHub
integration is less useful than other integrations. So what to do - the
solution is really quite simple. I have my own Slack domain and I use one of
the limited integrations for GitHub. Now I can configure which repos I get
notified about, what level of detail I have, all to my heart&rsquo;s content. And I
don&rsquo;t need to worry about bombarding others with GitHub notification overkill
as there is only one in my own community! With Slack powering how I get
notified I have all of the configurability Slack is known for across the many
Slack clients there are.</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=/posts/development/teacmity-pipeline-iteration-two/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i><span class=navigation-tittle>TeamCity Pipeline - iteration two</span></a>
