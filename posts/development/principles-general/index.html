As before, this isn’t in any particular order.\nBreak work down into as small chunks as it practicable If there is a large piece of work to be done, breaking it down into smaller chunks is generally a good idea. The chunks should be as small as makes sense within the context of where and how the work is happening. This is pretty much the idea behind the adage of trying to eat an elephant one bite at a time.\nThere are both benefits and considerations (not necessarily cons) for chunking up work. The benefits of smaller chunks of work include:\n Taken on their own, they are less complex It is easier to understand the dependencies between the chunks and work out which can be done in parallel, ideally leading to the ability (if there is the capacity) for the overall piece of work to be completed more quickly Having a unit of measurement i.e. a chunk of work from which a forecast can be generated (once there are some complete chunks) for remaining effort Identifying points to reflect on and assess what has been achieved, the value gained, whether it is worthwhile continuing, etc. are possible whereas if the work is a single thing that isn’t possible until the end  Considerations for chunking up the work include:\n Breaking work into chunks is more art than science and as such it isn’t going to be ‘correct’ (as there are several ways of doing it and it is likely going to vary by when it is done, by whom, what they know at the time, etc.) Overall, the complexity of the work is likely to remain, it is just going to be moved around and its nature might change. The individual pieces of work should be simpler but there are likely going to be dependencies between them that will need to be managed and understood  Consider what isn’t there as much as what is I think of this as a good practice mainly when reviewing code changes but it is much more applicable than that.\nWhen I’m doing code reviews, along with reviewing the things that have changed, I try to think about what hasn’t changed.\nIs there something that should have been changed? Perhaps some documentation needs to be updated or maybe another system is relying on some part of the application’s interface that isn’t immediately obvious as an external interface. The format of a generated file picked up by another system perhaps? Of course, in an ideal world this type of change would have a thorough and robust set of tests to ensure changes to it were flagged up. However, that isn’t always going to be the case and there is some stuff that just won’t be possible to test (at least with a reasonable cost). Understanding or at least having knowledge of the implications for changing systems beyond the system itself can be very valuable.\nAn indicator of not thinking like this can be an immediate approval of a code review. Whilst a very quick review is sometimes appropriate and can be welcome (after all, it means the code was good, doesn’t it?!). I do worry it hasn’t been given the appropriate level of scrutiny it deserves.\nWhen reviewing code I always feel a little disappointed in myself if I can’t find at least one thing to comment on.\nMaximise work not done I’m not sure everybody would agree with this sentiment but I think it is important to maximise the work not done. By which I mean I only want to be doing work that is valuable, whether that is for myself or for my employer. It is a good job my definition of valuable is quite broad! Ideally the goal of what is being done is to learn something new or improve current understanding.\nI place little value in being busy for the sake of being busy (there are times when this is OK but they are fairly limited). An example would be if there is a manual activity being repeatedly done, it should ideally be automated. Another example might be if somebody has a desire to analyse some organisational data from several data warehouses, it can be easy to just ask for all of it. If the effort to do that is the same it isn’t a problem. However, if the effort isn’t the same, the objective of the analysis needs to be more well defined. It might be that not everything is required and the effort can be reduced. Asking questions like this can also help to tease out the essence of the activity and understand the value of it.\nThe question is, ‘How do you maximise the work not done?’.\nI think techniques to understand the answer to the question work best when dealing with software as it is often relatively easy to figure out ways to learn more about the problem in safe ways and ways that are very close to the actual problem. The same is much harder to achieve in the physical world, although it is possible to learn what people want. Desire paths (aka lines) are a good example of this.\nWith software, opportunities are much easier to come by. An example I read and will always remember the moral of (if not the details) was about a company selling something like bird cages (it doesn’t really matter what it was).\nThe story goes along the lines of somebody wondered if there was a market for bird cages in their home country. They knew there was a big market in other countries but hadn’t seen any sellers in their country. In order to figure out if anybody was interested in buying bird cages they created an advertisement on a search engine with a contact form, not really expecting it to do much. Some short period of time later they were capturing a lot of contacts so they knew there was a market and could afford to invest in it. At this point the cost had been minimal and they had a database of people who were wanting to buy a product they didn’t have. A good position to be and much better than having a load of stock with no customers. They got in touch with the manufacturers and were able to get stock for their customers. There was a lot of manual effort to start with but they had a business they were able to make money from and grow.\nI like this story as it epitomises figuring out a very low cost, low effort way to learn if there was any demand from which a successful company was created. Very much maximising the work not done (until it was required). It would have been very different if the company had been setup, created a website for order fulfilment, got the manufacturers and shipping sorted without any income or knowledge whether there was a demand.\nYou build it, you run it I subscribe to the idea of ‘if you build it, you run’, from a software product perspective (there are caveats to this and the context is all important). It goes hand in hand with thinking about products as opposed to projects and intimately ties two frequently separated stages of a product’s life cycle (development and operating) together. Doing so brings some keys benefits such as:\n Consistency, an existing knowledge base and understanding of the history of the product A desire to make the product as good as possible as opposed to running somebody else’s thing A much reduced chance of rework so it fits in with the other products the operations teams manages There isn’t anybody else to point at when things break  These benefits all add up to providing a better product for the users. Which isn’t to say you can’t have great products that are built and operated by different teams of people but I believe there needs to be a clear lineage and relationship between the two groups for the best experience. And it tends to be easier to do that when it is the same team.\nDo not outsource your key competencies Lots of organisations outsource work and there are lots of good reasons to do so. When the work is mundane and not a reason why you are in business it makes a lot of sense. It might be something like a bakery buying accounting software or a plane maker employing a security contractor. This make sense, neither of those businesses are outsourcing the reason they have a business.\nIt becomes odd when you hear about businesses outsourcing their own business. For example, a business providing specialist recruitment services should not be outsourcing recruitment services to external parties. If you are paying an external entity to do your business you are losing out on all of the learning you should be doing about your business. This is effectively paying somebody to learn about what makes your business a business.\nIn most cases that isn’t going to turn out so well. That might happen quickly or it might be a slower decline where you are being put in a position where your competitors, at least the ones who have been learning about the business will be able to out manoeuvre you. Something you do not want that to happen.\n","wordCount":"1580","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-03-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-03-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Steve Hunt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/development/principles-general/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"A blog by st3v3nhunt","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me accesskey=h title="A blog by st3v3nhunt (Alt + H)">A blog by st3v3nhunt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>General working principles</h1><div class=post-meta><span title="2021-03-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">04 March 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Steve Hunt&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/st3v3nhunt/st3v3nhunt.github.io/tree/main/content/posts/development/principles-general.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#break-work-down-into-as-small-chunks-as-it-practicable aria-label="Break work down into as small chunks as it practicable">Break work down into as small chunks as it practicable</a></li><li><a href=#consider-what-isnt-there-as-much-as-what-is aria-label="Consider what isn&amp;rsquo;t there as much as what is">Consider what isn&rsquo;t there as much as what is</a></li><li><a href=#maximise-work-not-done aria-label="Maximise work not done">Maximise work not done</a></li><li><a href=#you-build-it-you-run-it aria-label="You build it, you run it">You build it, you run it</a></li><li><a href=#do-not-outsource-your-key-competencies aria-label="Do not outsource your key competencies">Do not outsource your key competencies</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Following on from the post about
