The post contains some thoughts I had about the video and thought it would be worth capturing them and maybe try to get back into blogging at some regular interval, although clearly that didn’t happen at the time…\nTL;DR The video is relatively short and worth the time to watch. It is an overview and comparison or microservices and monoliths. Sam does a good job of highlighting the difficulties and challenges around ‘doing’ microservices, provoking thought on the subject.\nI’ve not seen a GOTO video in this style before (and as it turns out five months later I’ve not seen another like it either). I think I like it. It certainly makes the video easier to digest in chunks and provides a breakdown of the key takeaway points which can be useful when reviewing the video yourself or discussing with others.\nMy Commentary In order to provide some structure, I’ll cover the different themes from the video.\nChange is Hard I totally agree with the sentiment of how the people side of change is really hard and actually making things change, in a lasting way, is incredibly tough. Without having any empirical data I would imagine change is likely doomed to fail most of the time. Perhaps in a similar vein to how a gambler only ever tells you about their success people only ever tell you about successful changes…\nFrom my experiences, I think changing the ways of working within an organisation needs to originate from where the power-base resides. By power-base I mean the group of people (sometimes an individual) that can veto decisions and has the final say on whether something is going to happen or not. In some organisations that will be product development team(s) and they will be able to tread a path that will be followed by others. However, I think for a lot of organisations the power resides in the operational teams. If change is attempted without the operational team either leading it, or at the very least being heavily involved, the change is likely going to fail. I’ve seen product development teams attempt to make changes with the hope that others will follow, however, as it is ultimately the operations teams that are responsible for the running of the product, the change hits a hard stop at the boundary of the product development team’s sphere of influence.\nOf course there are other power-bases within organisations but it often ends up being held by a small number of people or perhaps a individual. Some organisations operate by diktat and when one arrives from on high, that can force change. However, the forcing of change is generally not an effective way to achieve change. It may achieve rapid change in the short term but there are likely longer term issues having the ground work laid to causes problems in the future. Forced change also risks getting exactly what was asked for as opposed to being the change that the sentiment intended, thus loosing the benefits of making the change in the first instance.\nIn my experience, achieving change is much easier when the change is being instigated by the people that build the thing and run the thing. The reason this works is that the sphere of influence of that team encompasses everything where change will happen.\nJust how many organisations have this setup? I wish it were more but there are many reasons why it isn’t common. One of them being the idea of dev-ops is much newer than the how long organisations have been around and changing an organisation from one where development and operations are separate to one where they are working together, even moderately so is yet more change and as we know now, change is difficult. Sam touched on it briefly towards the end of the video, asking a team of people who have never been on call to start doing it isn’t as easy as it sounds. Often the financial reward isn’t commensurate with the sacrifices (either perceived or real) required. In this case it can boil down to whether the person really cares about the thing they are working on, in some cases that isn’t going to be a problem but in others it most certainly will be. And of course going on call may well require contracts to be renegotiated which be tricky.\nI’ve thought about this issue on and off in the time between drafting and publishing this post. I’m at the stage of believing a lot of the problems around change are due to the culture of an organisation along with the structure. If an organisation’s culture is one built on minimising change then it is going to be much more difficult to make meaningful and lasting change. If the culture is one of adaptability and embracing change then making internal changes is likely going to be easy. I’ll get round to writing more about organisation culture at some point.\nUsing Microservices Touching on the reasons for using microservices, it was interesting how Martin picked up on highlighting the business benefits of having independent deploy-ability such as lowering risks and providing business units/product teams with more autonomy (linking into the communication interfaces of APIs) rather than focussing on having this often nebulous ability to deploy things independently. Deploying with zero down time is interesting as although it has a business benefit (and an easy non-functional requirement to say is a must), it depends on the business as to how much value it really is.\nThinking about how this applies to my experiences, I’ve seen really robust, slick deployment capabilities be somewhat wasted as the ‘continuous delivery’ pipeline stopped before deploying to the production environment. And the production environment deployment was handled in a totally different manner.\nIf the continuous delivery pipeline doesn’t end in delivering the product to the production environment I’m no sure how accurate it is to call it continuous deliver. Maybe if it is contextualised e.g. ‘a continuous delivery pipeline to staging’ (or whatever is the last environment) at least this makes it clear it isn’t a complete delivery pipeline.\nThis brings me onto deployments and how things are actually done.\nDeployments A major benefit to microservices over monoliths is their independent deploy-ability. However, I’d argue this doesn’t matter if the deployments aren’t done frequently (resulting in many changes being bundled together across many microservices) or they are done in such a way that all microservices within the larger system are deployed in one go. This might have been what was referred to in the video when Sam mentioned an organisation that had been able to deploy independently at some point but never did it and as a result lost the capability.\nWhy bother with the cost of the flexibility of being able to do something if the reality is that it is never utilised. It is analogous to buying a vehicle with seven seats and loads of luggage space and only ever using it to drive yourself around. It might be really flexible but the reality is not only did it cost more to purchase in the first place there is an ongoing cost of maintaining the larger vehicle.\nThis leads onto the mention of the cost of things.\nCosts of Doing Things It was good to hear a bit of discussion about thinking about the costs of doing things. It seems really common for solutions to be chosen because they could solve everything and could be extended to cater for all eventualities but the reality is that there is a cost involved in having that level of flexibility and most of the time this isn’t thought about too much.\nWhat is the cost of having a system be so generic and abstract when trying to develop things or maintain those things or run those things? Where does the domain knowledge reside? Does it get spread throughout multiple systems with different teams being responsible for the different systems?\nI’ve seen a system just like this go from a configurable master-piece where no development resource was ever going to be required to something that needed development input regularly as edge cases were discovered and the complexity of the system became overbearing. The result being a very costly system in every aspect of its life cycle, from design to development to maintenance. To the ability to understand the implications of changes to it and by it. Not the way to go.\nCommunication via APIs/Microservices Linked to the challenge of making changes is difficulties in communication across large groups, mainly because people are people. I’m very much a proponent of providing interfaces between teams in the form of APIs and microservices as it leaves no room for interpretation, at least that is the idea, obviously it doesn’t always work in practice.\nSummary This post is quite long and wordy, fortunately I’ve added a TL;DR which can be reduced further to just recommending the video is watched. Along with stating that context is everything when deciding whether to use microservices or not.\n","wordCount":"1548","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-09-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-09-14T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Steve Hunt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/when-to-use-microservices/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"A blog by st3v3nhunt","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me accesskey=h title="A blog by st3v3nhunt (Alt + H)">A blog by st3v3nhunt</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/til/ title=TIL><span>TIL</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>🔬 When to Use Microservices (And When Not to!)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title="2020-09-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">14 September 2020</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Steve Hunt&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/st3v3nhunt/st3v3nhunt.github.io/tree/main/content/posts/when-to-use-microservices.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#tldr aria-label=TL;DR>TL;DR</a></li><li><a href=#my-commentary aria-label="My Commentary">My Commentary</a><ul><li><a href=#change-is-hard aria-label="Change is Hard">Change is Hard</a></li><li><a href=#using-microservices aria-label="Using Microservices">Using Microservices</a></li><li><a href=#deployments aria-label=Deployments>Deployments</a></li><li><a href=#costs-of-doing-things aria-label="Costs of Doing Things">Costs of Doing Things</a></li><li><a href=#communication-via-apismicroservices aria-label="Communication via APIs/Microservices">Communication via APIs/Microservices</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#summary aria-label=Summary>Summary</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>I watched
