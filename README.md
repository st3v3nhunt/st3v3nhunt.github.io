# [blog.st3v3nhunt.me](https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/) blog source

> This repo contains the source for
  [blog.st3v3nhunt.me](https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/)

The blog uses the [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/)
theme and is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Clone repo

Clone the repo and submodules:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/st3v3nhunt/st3v3nhunt.github.io
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Workflow

1. Create new posts manually or via Hugo's CLI
  [`hugo new`](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_new/). A new development post is
  created by default e.g. `hugo new Title-of-new-post` creates a post with the
  specified and hyphens replaced with spaces.

1. Run the site locally (to check the content) via `hugo server`.

1. When happy with the new content, push the changes to the remote. GitHub
   Actions will generate the content into `./public` on the `gh-pages` branch.

There is another post archetype, a `til` (things/today I learnt). To
create this run `hugo new til/<title-of-post>`. The front matter is different
from development posts. All `til`s can be found under `/til`.

The order of the tils is controlled by the `weight` set in the front matter of
the `_index.md` file in the folder for the til. `weight` must be an integer and
greater than 0.

## Notes

Files added to [static/](./static) are included in the built output that is
pushed to `gh-pages` branch. Therefore, should a file need to be added to the
deployed app e.g. `CNAME` add it to `static`.
