# [st3v3nhunt.github.io](https://st3v3nhunt.github.io/) blog source - pre-generated

> This repo contains the raw source for
  [st3v3nhunt.github.io](https://st3v3nhunt.github.io)

The blog uses the [hyde-hyde](https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-hyde/) theme and is
generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Workflow

Create new posts manually or via Hugo's CLI e.g.
[`hugo new`](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_new/).

Run the site locally (to check the content) via `hugo server`.

When happy with the new content use `deploy.sh` to re-generate the site and
push the changes to the repo setup as the remote for the `public` dir.
Alternatively, this can be done manually (using the instructions in `deploy.sh`
as a basis).
