This is a little bit about how work at where I work works.

## Visualisation of work

[Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)). Is the system used
to visual the work. It includes who is involved, what they are involved in,
what state work is in and whether there are things getting in the way. The
currency of the work is a story. The more stories completed, the richer
everybody is. Flow is everything.

## The currency of work

The vessel of all work is a story. Stories have a size, small (S), medium (M)
or large (L). The size of a story is dictated by the complexity of the work
involved. This is often based on the number of systems that will need to be
changed to complete the work.

### What does a story look like?

There is no set definition of what a story is (perhaps there never will be
although it would probably be a good idea). The level at which a story is
created varies. Some of the experiences differing levels of story have provided
are:

1. One project had stories focused on the technical activities required to get
   the work done. They were very much like tasks. Stories at this level moved
   through the board quickly, this built momentum. It worked well for technical
   people. It did not work well for non-technical people. The board was flooded
   with stories that made little sense to business people. However good it
   might have been for the technical team, not having the business understand
   the state of the project is not a good position to be in. Especially when a
   goal of the project is to increase the level of participation of the
   business in the development of products.

1. Another project had stories written at a much higher level, one where they
   would provide some real value to the Product Owner (PO). There were far
   fewer stories and each story was much clearer about what was being
   delivered. This approach worked much better from the point of view of
   looking at the board and understanding the state of the project. Business
   people were much more bought in. This is a very good thing. However, it was
   not all roses and sunshine. The major loss was the flow of stories through
   the board. The board stagnated. How to improve on this is an on-going
   concern. Probable solutions revolve around another board, a 'technical'
   board, however, this has its' own challenges.

## Free flowing

One of the goals of Kanban is to increase the rate at which stories flow
through the board. This is referred to in two ways - cycle time and lead time.

### Lead time

This is how long it takes a story to get across the entirety of the board. From
initial state to end state. It is useful to see how long an idea takes to go
from inception to realisation. Often used by the business.

### Cycle time

This is how long is takes a story to get to done i.e. from the time it leaves
the backlog until it reaches the end state. Provides information on the time it
takes to do the work. Used by the team doing the work.

### Why should anybody care about lead and cycle time?

There are many reasons to care about lead and cycle times. My number one reason
is, the smaller the time it takes to get something to the end state (which
should really be the production environment) the quicker the product can be
iterated.

The quicker the product can be iterated, the quicker the wants of the users of
the product can be met, the happier those users can be made, the more users
there will be. Ultimately ending in the beating of competitors whilst providing
the best product possible, built based on the needs of the users. Win, win.
