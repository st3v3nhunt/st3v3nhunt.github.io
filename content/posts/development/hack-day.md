This is a post I have been sat on for some time. In fact the date of the day in
question was 01/02/2016 so some details are going to be a little inaccurate but
hopefully the essence is maintained.

Once upon a time I participated in a
[hack day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) where not a single line of
code was written.
"Hang on", I hear you cry. How can you have a hack day without doing any
hacking? Indeed, this is exactly what I was wondering. Looking around the
Internet for definitions and details of hack days, the vast majority of them
talk about technology and software as a core part of the day. However, there
are a number of information sources where hack days are discussed in the
context of no software hacking being involved. I think in these instances it is
better to think of the day as a product ideation day which is exactly what it
turned out to be. Not quite as snappy a title as 'hack day' though ðŸ˜‰!

With that cleared up, what was the day like?

## What did we do during the day?

* Met new people
* Selected a user need (from a pre-defined list)
* Fleshed out the user need (with a micro-persona and acceptance criteria)
* Expanded on the solution/need
* Refined the solution
* Created a (paper based) prototype
* Carried out user research (with members of the other groups)
* Iterated the solution based on feedback
* Replayed it all to the group (providing everybody a chance to see each others
  prototype and gain some insight into each group's thinking)

## Outputs from the day

Beyond the opportunity to meet and work with (potentially) an entirely new
group of people, thinking from a number of different POVs is a really
refreshing exercise. Empathising is an underused skill by most people and this
day really requires people to empathise. A lot.
From thinking about how a person/people within a set scenario might actually be
feeling and how that translates into generating their 'needs' to thinking about
what the future might look like for them individually and society as a whole.
From understanding the new people you are working with in double quick time in
order to combine to form a productive group to thinking about how other groups
saw the challenge and solved it. The process is much more important than the
outcome in days like this.

## Changes I would make for future days

* Name the day more clearly (it helps to set expectations early)
* Ensure the constraints being worked within are well understood by
  participants e.g. it needs to be something possible to build tomorrow vs
  something that might be possible in 5 years time. This helps prototypes to be
  of a similar 'feel' rather than having some being current period solutions
  and others being far-future Sci-Fi dreams! Unless that is what you want in
  which case go for it.

## Summary

I enjoyed the day and will look to participate in future days. I highly
recommend others getting involved given the chance. And if not given the chance
it is reasonably easy to set something up yourself.
