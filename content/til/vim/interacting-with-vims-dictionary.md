Add a misspelt word to Vim's dictionary with `zg`.

See the list of suggestions for a misspelt word with `z=`. Enter the number of
the correct suggestion and hit enter to select it.

If you pre-emptively know the number of the suggestion you can choose that by
entering `<number>z=`. Although knowing what number to choose is a little
tricky, perhaps the first suggestion is worth a punt?
