Accessing an environment variable within Neovim from a lua script is straight
forward. It is just a case of calling `vim.env.env-var-name` where
`env-var-name` is the name of the environment variable e.g.

```lua
local homebrew_prefix = vim.env.HOMEBREW_PREFIX
print(homebrew_prefix)
```

Would print the value of the `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX` env var.
