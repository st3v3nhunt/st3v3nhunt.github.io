title: "Things I've learnt"
---

Each entry under things I've learnt (TIL) is intended to be relatively short
and concise. Hopefully this will encourage me to write and publish them more
often and not hoard partially written posts in private notebooks.

They will be categorised under a single main thing i.e. TIL categories are not
tags. The main [posts](/posts) on the site already do this and TILs are meant
to be different.
