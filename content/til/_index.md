title: "Things I've learnt"
---

Each entry under things I've learnt (TIL) is meant to capture something I've
needed to Google (which is a lot of things! ðŸ˜…) and needed to spend more than a
few seconds looking for the answer. If I can find the answer in the results
page or maybe after a quick scroll on one of the result pages I'm not going to
record it here.

However, if there is a bit more searching or reading and comprehension
required I'll try to capture it here. One of the reasons I'm doing this is to
try and get that bit of knowledge to stick so I can recall it later or failing
that, perhaps I'll remember I've previously had the problem and I can save
myself a bit of effort and search this site.

I'm also trying to encourage myself to write and publish notes more
often, rather than hoarding them in private notebooks.

Each entry will be categorised under a single category i.e. TIL categories are
not tags. The main [posts](/posts) on the site already do this and TILs are
meant to be different.
