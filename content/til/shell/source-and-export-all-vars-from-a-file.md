If you ever need to load a bunch of env vars into an environment it is easily
accomplished by having them listed in a `.env` file e.g.

```sh
# .env
API_KEY=secret
export USERNAME=squirrel
```

If all of the env vars are preceded with `export` the file can simply be
sourced with `source .env`. However, if any of the env vars are not preceded
with `export` there is an option that can be set prior to sourcing the file to
achieve the same result. Running

```sh
set -a; source .env; set +a
```

will load all env vars listed and then turn off the option of exporting all
defined variables.
