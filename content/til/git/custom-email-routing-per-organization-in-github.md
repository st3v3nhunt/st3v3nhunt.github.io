Within [GitHub](https://github.com), if you belong to multiple organisations it
is easy to have those notifications routed to specific email addresses. This is
very useful if, for example, you use the same GitHub account for work and
personal use.

The first thing to do is to ensure you have
[added the email address to your account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account).
Then follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#customizing-email-routes-per-organization)
to customise the routing.
