[Pipelines in Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines) are pretty awesome. This is how I went about setting up a Node.js app to have automated deployments for all pull requests, an automated deployment to the staging environment and a manual stage for promoting to the production environment. Pretty much a bread and butter pipeline.
_(This is an image heavy post)_

### Pre-requisites:

* Existing Node.js app hosted in GitHub (it doesn't need to be GitHub. Dropbox and local git repos are supported by Heroku but pipelines have special features for GitHub repos). Feel free to fork the [node-js-getting-started repo](https://github.com/st3v3nhunt/node-js-getting-started) I used.
* An Heroku account (obvs ðŸ˜‰).


## Setting up the pipeline:

### An app for staging and review apps for pull requests.

I started by creating a new app in Heroku. I named it `name-not-in-use-staging`, note the end of the name i.e. `-staging`. I did this to make it easier to recognise which app is which when I add them to the pipeline:
![New app](/images/pipelines/create-new-app.png)

On the same screen I selected `Show more options...` so I could add the app to a new pipeline. I named the pipeline `pipeline-test` and I assigned the app to the `staging` slot:
![Add to pipeline](/images/pipelines/create-new-app-add-to-pipeline.png)

I then selected `Create App` which goes to this screen:
![Created app](/images/pipelines/app-created-and-added-to-pipeline.png)

Note the deployment method section. I followed the instructions and connected the app to my GitHub repo - [st3v3nhunt/node-js-getting-started](https://github.com/st3v3nhunt/node-js-getting-started).
I also opted for automatic deployments from the `master` branch, as seen below:
![App connected to GitHub](/images/pipelines/connect-to-github-and-setup-auto-deployments.png)

A little further down the screen there is the [Review apps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration-review-apps) section. As this app is part of a pipeline, review apps are managed by the pipeline.

![Review app setup link](/images/pipelines/begin-review-app-setup.png)

Following the link to manage review apps shows us the visualisation of the pipeline for the first time:
![Enable review apps in pipeline](/images/pipelines/enable-review-apps.png)

Selecting to `Enable Review Apps` pops up this screen:
![Setup review apps for all pull requests](/images/pipelines/set-review-apps-auto-deploy.png)

Where I opt for creating a review app for every pull request automatically.


When review apps are configured the pipeline will look like this:
![Review apps setup in pipeline](/images/pipelines/pipeline-with-review-apps.png)

Note there is nothing in the production slot. Next I will go through what to do in order to make it possible to have your staging app be promoted to production.

### Add an app for production

In order to have an app in production I need to create another app. In the screen below, note how the name is appended with `-prod`. As with the staging app, this is just a convention I use to help identify which app is which. In this step I have assigned the app to the production slot within the pipeline.

The pipeline is now complete. It will look something like this:

## Pipeline in action

Over the next few screens I'll show what happens to the pipeline as a pull request is created and flows through the application from being merged into master then promoted to production.

Pull requests are automatically deployed as part of the review apps functionality. The review app gives people involved in the pull request the opportunity to test the changes in an environment that is not where is was developed. No more ['works on my machine'](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program/) cries!
Not only is this good for providing an isolated test environment it also gets around problems that geographically dispersed people can find themselves in. I've had numerous occasions where the person I wanted to run through something with was not able to access my development machine. No more will that be a problem!

Once a pull request has been merged into `master` it will be automatically deployed into the staging environment:
![Auto deployment to staging](/images/pipelines/merged-pr-auto-deployed-to-staging.png)

As seen in the screen above, there is now a button to promote to production.

Clicking on the 'Promote to production...' button pops up the promote screen:
![Promote staging to production](/images/pipelines/promote-staging-to-production.png)

Simply selecting 'Promote' and when the changes have been promoted to production this is what the pipeline will look like:
![Production running latest code](/images/pipelines/promoted-to-production-app.png)

Additional pull requests will go through the same cycle.

## Further reading

Clearly this is a simple setup. Hopefully it has shown just how easy it is to get a pipeline setup in Heroku.

There is a host of guides available on Heroku, the [pipeline guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines) is good place to start if you are interested in finding out more.
