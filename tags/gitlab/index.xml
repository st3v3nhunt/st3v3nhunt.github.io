      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now I have had the &lt;a href=&#34;../teamcity-pipeline/&#34;&gt;TeamCity build
pipeline&lt;/a&gt; running for a while
I have had chance to review how it works. I have made a number of changes which
I have summarised, along with the reasoning below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>üéã Create branch based NuGet packages in TeamCity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reviewing the TeamCity build configuration I&amp;rsquo;d
&lt;a href=&#34;../teamcity-pipeline/&#34;&gt;setup&lt;/a&gt; with my colleagues, it
was pointed out every build was creating a new NuGet package. Not great when
you consider every branch was triggering a build and most of those branches
were not &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I setup a build configuration in TeamCity. I thought
I would record what I did this time around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ü§î How I work with Git</title>
      <link>https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/how-i-work-with-git/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/how-i-work-with-git/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy introducing people to Git. Pretty much without fail they see how
much better their development work-flow can be and find their work more
enjoyable as a result. This is especially true if they are coming from a TFS
background. See how I work with
&lt;a href=&#34;../how-i-work-with-git-and-tfs/&#34;&gt;Git and TFS&lt;/a&gt;.
However, with pleasure comes pain. For Git, that pain is in getting over the
learning curve. The size and steepness of the curve varies depending on
previous experience of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software&#34;&gt;Version Control Systems&lt;/a&gt;.
In my experience, TFS does not provide a good base knowledge to work from as it
tries to hide as much as possible from the user. Clearly Git is doing a lot for
you too but the way it works is more exposed. For example, even the most basic
of things like adding files into the index can seem strange to a TFS user.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
