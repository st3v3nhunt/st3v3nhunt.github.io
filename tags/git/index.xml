      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, if you belong to multiple organisations it
is easy to have those notifications routed to specific email addresses. This is
very useful if, for example, you use the same GitHub account for work and
personal use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-with-a-non-cloud-hosted-git-remote&#34;&gt;Working with a non-cloud hosted Git remote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often work in environments where the code is centrally stored in TFS. And as
I hate, HATE, &lt;strong&gt;HATE&lt;/strong&gt; TFS I have to find other ways to interact with the VCS
to keep my sanity. &lt;a href=&#34;http://git-tfs.com/&#34;&gt;GitTFS&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue. I&amp;rsquo;ve written
about this &lt;a href=&#34;../how-i-work-with-git-and-tfs/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to provide a consistent development environment between team members
as well as making it easier to do physical pair programming sharing a
&lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt; is a good thing to do. After all, when using another person&amp;rsquo;s
machine there are few things more annoying than not having access to the same
shortcuts you rely on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ü§î How I work with Git</title>
      <link>https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/how-i-work-with-git/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy introducing people to Git. Pretty much without fail they see how
much better their development work-flow can be and find their work more
enjoyable as a result. This is especially true if they are coming from a TFS
background. See how I work with
&lt;a href=&#34;../how-i-work-with-git-and-tfs/&#34;&gt;Git and TFS&lt;/a&gt;.
However, with pleasure comes pain. For Git, that pain is in getting over the
learning curve. The size and steepness of the curve varies depending on
previous experience of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software&#34;&gt;Version Control Systems&lt;/a&gt;.
In my experience, TFS does not provide a good base knowledge to work from as it
tries to hide as much as possible from the user. Clearly Git is doing a lot for
you too but the way it works is more exposed. For example, even the most basic
of things like adding files into the index can seem strange to a TFS user.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post has been one I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write for months and months.
Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ve got round to it! This does mean specifics are going to be few and

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After having added a new remote to my local git repository via &lt;code&gt;git remote add other-remote git@github.com:user/other-repo&lt;/code&gt; I wanted to checkout one of the

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;git branch -r&lt;/code&gt; to check the list of branches on the remote can often
lead to a long list of branches making it difficult to tell which are active
e.g.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
