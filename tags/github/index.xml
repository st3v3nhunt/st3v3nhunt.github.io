      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty decent cloud based
&lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; repository. I would put it in my top 2 along with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ü§î How I work with Git</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy introducing people to Git. Pretty much without fail they see how
much better their development work-flow can be and find their work more
enjoyable as a result. This is especially true if they are coming from a TFS
background. See how I work with
&lt;a href=&#34;../how-i-work-with-git-and-tfs/&#34;&gt;Git and TFS&lt;/a&gt;.
However, with pleasure comes pain. For Git, that pain is in getting over the
learning curve. The size and steepness of the curve varies depending on
previous experience of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software&#34;&gt;Version Control Systems&lt;/a&gt;.
In my experience, TFS does not provide a good base knowledge to work from as it
tries to hide as much as possible from the user. Clearly Git is doing a lot for
you too but the way it works is more exposed. For example, even the most basic
of things like adding files into the index can seem strange to a TFS user.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
