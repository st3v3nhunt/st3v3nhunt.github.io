      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common architectural style (at the time of writing) is to split up
applications into many, smaller, more focussed applications. Frequently this
style is known by the term &lt;code&gt;microservices&lt;/code&gt;. When working with microservices
I&amp;rsquo;ve rarely had the need to run, and actually use, more than a single web
application concurrently in my development environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I watched
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTdnfD6s5Q&#34;&gt;When To Use Microservices (And When Not to!)&lt;/a&gt;
soon after it was published but never got round to publishing this post, which
I wrote at the same time but have edited more recently so I could publish it.
The post contains some thoughts I had about the video and thought it would be
worth capturing them and maybe try to get back into blogging at some regular
interval, although clearly that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen at the time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
