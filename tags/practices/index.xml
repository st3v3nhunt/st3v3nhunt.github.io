      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common architectural style (at the time of writing) is to split up
applications into many, smaller, more focussed applications. Frequently this
style is known by the term &lt;code&gt;microservices&lt;/code&gt;. When working with microservices
I&amp;rsquo;ve rarely had the need to run, and actually use, more than a single web
application concurrently in my development environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from the post about
&lt;a href=&#34;../principles-dev/&#34;&gt;development practices and principles&lt;/a&gt;
I wanted to capture principles more related to general ways of thinking and
working. As before, this isn&amp;rsquo;t in any particular order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my time working in software development I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a few guiding
principles I try to consistently follow. Some of them have always been the way
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to work and others have been adopted after having been burnt by not
using it in the first place or learning better ways of doing and thinking
about things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>„Ä∞Ô∏è How to setup a simple Heroku pipeline</title>
      <link>https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/how-to-setup-a-simple-heroku-pipeline/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines&#34;&gt;Pipelines in Heroku&lt;/a&gt; are
pretty awesome. This is how I went about setting up a Node.js app to have
automated deployments for all pull requests, an automated deployment to the
staging environment and a manual stage for promoting to the production
environment. Pretty much a bread and butter pipeline.
&lt;em&gt;(This is an image heavy post)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post I have been sat on for some time. In fact the date of the day in
question was 01/02/2016 so some details are going to be a little inaccurate but
hopefully the essence is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
