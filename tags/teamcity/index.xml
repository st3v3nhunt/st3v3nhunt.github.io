      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now I have had the &lt;a href=&#34;../teamcity-pipeline/&#34;&gt;TeamCity build
pipeline&lt;/a&gt; running for a while
I have had chance to review how it works. I have made a number of changes which
I have summarised, along with the reasoning below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reviewing the TeamCity build configuration I&amp;rsquo;d
&lt;a href=&#34;../teamcity-pipeline/&#34;&gt;setup&lt;/a&gt; with my colleagues, it
was pointed out every build was creating a new NuGet package. Not great when
you consider every branch was triggering a build and most of those branches
were not &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I setup a build configuration in TeamCity. I thought
I would record what I did this time around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
