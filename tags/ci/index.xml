      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now I have had the &lt;a href=&#34;../teamcity-pipeline/&#34;&gt;TeamCity build
pipeline&lt;/a&gt; running for a while
I have had chance to review how it works. I have made a number of changes which
I have summarised, along with the reasoning below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>🎋 Create branch based NuGet packages in TeamCity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reviewing the TeamCity build configuration I&amp;rsquo;d
&lt;a href=&#34;../teamcity-pipeline/&#34;&gt;setup&lt;/a&gt; with my colleagues, it
was pointed out every build was creating a new NuGet package. Not great when
you consider every branch was triggering a build and most of those branches
were not &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I setup a build configuration in TeamCity. I thought
I would record what I did this time around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>〰️ How to setup a simple Heroku pipeline</title>
      <link>https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/posts/how-to-setup-a-simple-heroku-pipeline/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines&#34;&gt;Pipelines in Heroku&lt;/a&gt; are
pretty awesome. This is how I went about setting up a Node.js app to have
automated deployments for all pull requests, an automated deployment to the
staging environment and a manual stage for promoting to the production
environment. Pretty much a bread and butter pipeline.
&lt;em&gt;(This is an image heavy post)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
