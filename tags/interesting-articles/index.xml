      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked to provide a link to an article that had resonated with me
in the recent past. The first thing I did was provide a link to my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/st3v3nhunt&#34;&gt;twitter account&lt;/a&gt; to that person. Thinking
(hoping) the question would be answered.
The second thing I did was to go through some of my time line to see what
articles I had tweeted about. One of the things I found was I didn&amp;rsquo;t tweet all
that often about articles I find align well to how I think. There are some but
there is a lot of stuff I read and do nothing with. There are even fewer tweets
about things I don&amp;rsquo;t feel align well with me which is probably a good thing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
